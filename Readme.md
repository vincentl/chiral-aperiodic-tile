This project contains a python3 implementation of the algorithm described 
in Appendix A of [arXiv:2305.17743 [math.CO]](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2305.17743)
and several sample output tilings. One application of the tiling files is
for laser cutting multiple tiles with minimal waste.

# What is an Chiral Aperiodic Monotile?

- **monotile** = single tile can tile the xy-plane
- **aperiodic** = the tiling pattern _never_ repeats
- **chiral** = there are incompatible left handed and right handed versions of the tile

Tilings (or tessellations) have been studied for a very long time, but this
generator is based on a discovery first published in 2023.  It is a solution
to the [einstein problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_problem) (see Wikipedia).

# Usage

Algorithm A proceeds in generations. We call the starting tile generation 0. The number of 
tiles grows quickly, so generations much above 5 are expensive to compute and difficult
to display.

Pick a generation number (for example 2) and an output file (for example `demo.svg`). Then 
run

```bash
python3 algorithm-a.py --generations 2 demo.svg
```

# Laser Cutting Tiles

Since the tiles are aperiodic, there is not a simple way to arrange the tiles for
laser cutting. Simply spacing the tiles in a grid leaving significant waste between tiles.
The algorithm for producing a tiling does not produce a simple rectangular tiling. By
starting with a tiling with a large enough rectangular patch for the intended cut-stock,
use a program like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) to remove the paths beyond the
desired cut area.

# Sample Tiles

The `examples` directory contains sample tiles. The colors are used to group paths based
on which generation produced the path - 0 is red, 1 is cyan, etc. The four red nodes are
the anchor nodes used in Algorithm A to orient the current generation supertile in
producing the next generation supertile.
